Solving graph problems

1. Describe the problem using graphs terminology
    What are your nodes?
    Where are nodes connected?
    What are your connected components?

2. Build your graph, or write your getNeighbors()
    Figure out how to get the node's edges

3. Choose your algorithm, and apply it
